## Overview of Project
	The playwriter, Louise, estimates an over $10K budget for her coming play, fever. She needs some advice to arrange a crowdfunding campaign to fund the play.  
	The project focus on using excel to conduct an analysis by existing site data to see if fundraising dates and goal amount are specific factors to determine if compaign sccucceeded. The analysis should offer Louise some guidelines on launch date and goal to arrange her campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
	Although, there are 4,113 campaigns records in existing site data. Since Louise is look for funding for play, which is a subcategory belongs to thether category, we make a line chart using 1,369 records which are related to theater. The line chart shows if companigns outcome will have a different pattern between launches in different month. Then, while there are three types of subcategory, plays, musical,spcaes, in thether category, we make a statistical table and convert the table into a line chart to see if the play's compaign outcome has any corelationship with different goal amount.
## Result
